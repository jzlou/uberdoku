# Uberdoku solver

Near my house, there is a geocache that has an uberdoku (16x16 sudoku) that must be solved in order to progress the puzzle.

Naturally, the correct solution is to solve this with constraint programming.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.7
* ORTools
* numpy

## Inputs
* input.csv of the 16x16 grid

## Acknowledgements
Thank you jdevor for the geocache puzzle, pintowar for the ORtools tutorial. and google for ORtools. :)
